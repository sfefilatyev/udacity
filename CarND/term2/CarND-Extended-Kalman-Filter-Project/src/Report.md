Dealing with the first frame, in particular, offers opportunities for improvement.
Experiment and see how low your RMSE can go!
Try removing radar or lidar data from the filter. Observe how your estimations change when running against a single sensor type! Do the results make sense given what you know about the nature of radar and lidar data?
We give you starter code, but you are not required to use it! You may want to start from scratch if: You want a bigger challenge! You want to redesign the project architecture. There are many valid design patterns for approaching the Kalman Filter algorithm. Feel free to experiment and try your own! You want to use a different coding style, eg. functional programming. While C++ code naturally tends towards being object-oriented in nature, it's perfectly reasonable to attempt a functional approach. Give it a shot and maybe you can improve its efficiency!
